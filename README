sfPluploadPlugin By Kevin Dew <kev@dewsolutions.co.uk>
======================================================

This is a symfony 1.x plugin for dealing with uploads created by plupload.

This contains:
  * An action for receiving requests by plupload
  * A class to build together the uploaded files

This doesn't contain:
  * plupload (get it from plupload.com)
  * widgets / validators, the one's I've wrote are descendants of other library
    code so haven't put them here although I have some examples in this gist:
    https://gist.github.com/788986

It's designed so that the files can be sent to a url which specifies a form
and a validator which can be used in processing.
